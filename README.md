### Hi there I'm N. Shimazu, a back-end developerðŸ‘‹

I'm a high school student living in Chicago, but I'm Japanese.
I started coding when I was 11, but I fell in love with Django when I was 14.
I love Python and Django, and I use them most of the time.
I know a little about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I use Bootstrap a lot, so I don't use HTML or CSS very much.
Most of my repositories are private because they relate to my little business with restaurants in the neighborhood. So you can't find the best of mine unfortunately


**What I'm learning**
 - Swift and Swift UI.
 - Java
 - Kotlin
 - C++
 - JavaScript

**What I've been working on**
 - A little business with restaurants in the neighborhood
 - A little system for my dad's company
